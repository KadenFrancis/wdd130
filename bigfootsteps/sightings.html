                <br>Sighting 1:</br>
                The original photo of Bigfoot, called the 'Patterson-Gimlin Film', was taken in Northern California in 1967. Patterson and Gimlin were horseback riding near Bluff Creek when they encountered an enormous oversized tree. Continuing on, they encoutnered a large hairy creature standing among debris from a flood from years before. Patterson died of cancer in 1972 and claimed he was certain the creature was real all the way up to his death.

                <br>Sighting 2:</br>
                This image displays Bigfoot seen walking through a forest in Utah's payson canyon. Taken by a nature photographer, the video shows the photographer's perspective after hearing a sound in the woods. The photographer pans the camera right, and Bigfoot enters the frame. Unfortunately, the video was very shaky and blurry, and the photographer left immediately after the encounter, so specific details on this sighting are scarce.

                <br>Sighting 3:</br>
                This third sighting clearly displays a large, hairy, humanoid creature crouched by a stream. The video was taken by a man kayaking down the Cass River in Michigan. The video shows the figure carrying something in its arms, which some speculate to be a young Bigfoot, perhaps the child of the larger creature.
